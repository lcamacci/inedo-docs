[Webhooks](/docs/proget/advanced/webhooks) let you connect two tools to notify users, trigger automated workflows, or audit certain events. ProGet's webhooks are highly customizable: seven different "methods" (like "Post" or "Delete") and six different "events" (like "Pulled" or "Promoted") give you a possible 156 different notification alerts. 

In this page, we show you how to connect ProGet to Teams and sample payload messages to copy/paste into your own webhook.
